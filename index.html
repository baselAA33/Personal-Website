    <p style="color:indigo;font-size:20px;"><b>1. Emo-bot:</b></p>
    <p style="color:indigo;">Created a project involving three team members called “emobot” – An AI that detects faces of people in an online meeting platform such as zoom and displays their emotions using machine learning and an AI model we developed. My task was to write a Python program and integrate it on Zoom to display the data the AI was providing in the form of a bar graph that updates continuously. </p>
    <p style="color:indigo;font-size:20px;"><b>2. Press E to escape:</b></p>
    <p style="color:indigo;">Worked with a partner to develop & present a video-game that won top laurels in the school’s annual tech fair. Created a game similar to “Temple Run” & “Mario” but in 2D using the unity engine and C#. I was responsible for the animation of the obstacles & characters, coding the physics of the game and the movement of the character while my partner was responsible for designing the map.
</p>
    <p style="color:indigo;font-size:20px;"><b>3. Chess Game API:</b></p>
    <p style="color:indigo;">Developed a program that acts as a sort of “referee” for a simplified variant of chess by making sure that each player makes only valid moves, by tracking the history of the game, and by announcing a winner.</p>
    <p style="color:indigo;font-size:20px;"><b>4. 2D Collision Detector:</b></p>
    <p style="color:indigo;">Created a recursive algorithm in an interactive 2D physics simulation involving many balls bouncing around that detects when two balls are colliding with each other and resolves it by separating the two balls and modeling a momentum transfer between them. It then updates the positions of all the balls using their new velocities.</p>
    <p style="color:indigo;font-size:20px;"><b>5. Course Registration Model:</b></p>
    <p style="color:indigo;">Developed a program that models a set of courses and a set of students who register for university courses, and details such as a course waitlist and a course drop using an array of singly linked lists and a hashmap.</p>
    <p style="color:indigo;font-size:20px;"><b>6. Closest Antenna Problem:</b></p>
    <p style="color:indigo;">Created a recursive algorithm that finds the closest pair of antenna towers on a grid of land full of antenna towers owned by two organizations to minimize signal loss during transmission when one organization tries to communicate with the other.</p>
