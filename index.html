	<p id="b">I'm currently a second year student at McGill University studying Software Engineering in the faculty of Science, hailing from Karachi, Pakistan. I have an interest in Machine Learning, Software/Game development, and Cyber-Security. I am a detail-oriented, diligent, punctual individual and team-player seeking internship opportunities.</p>
        <p id="b">I have experience working as a software intern at Base Camp Data Solutions focusing on maintaining and updating databases using C# and SQL. I am skilled in programming languages such as Python, Java, C, C#, and SQL, and have also participated in various programming competitions and a hackathon.</p>
    <p id="b">Apart from academia, I love playing video-games, reading books, going out on adventurous hikes, and playing sports, specifically football and cricket. Currently, I'm exploring new technologies, reading about tech history, keeping up with the latest industry developments, logging my favorite shows and most importantly, keeping myself on-track with my studies.</p>

    <p style="color:lavender;font-size:20px;"><b>1. Emo-bot: </b></p>
    <a href="https://github.com/baselAA33/Emotion-Detection-Using-CNN" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/536/536452.png" alt="GitHub" width="60" height="55""></a>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">Created a project involving three team members called “emobot” – An AI that detects faces of people in an online meeting platform such as zoom and displays their emotions using machine learning and an AI model we developed. My task was to write a Python program and integrate it on Zoom to display the data the AI was providing in the form of a bar graph that updates continuously. </p>
    <p style="color:lavender;font-size:20px;"><b>2. Press E to escape:</b></p>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">Worked with a partner to develop & present a video-game that won top laurels in the school’s annual tech fair. Created a game similar to “Temple Run” & “Mario” but in 2D using the unity engine and C#. I was responsible for the animation of the obstacles & characters, coding the physics of the game and the movement of the character while my partner was responsible for designing the map.
</p>
    <p style="color:lavender;font-size:20px;"><b>3. Chess Game API:</b></p>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">Developed a program that acts as a sort of “referee” for a simplified variant of chess by making sure that each player makes only valid moves, by tracking the history of the game, and by announcing a winner.</p>
    <p style="color:lavender;font-size:20px;"><b>4. 2D Collision Detector:</b></p>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">Created a recursive algorithm in an interactive 2D physics simulation involving many balls bouncing around that detects when two balls are colliding with each other and resolves it by separating the two balls and modeling a momentum transfer between them. It then updates the positions of all the balls using their new velocities.</p>
    <p style="color:lavender;font-size:20px;"><b>5. Course Registration Model:</b></p>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">Developed a program that models a set of courses and a set of students who register for university courses, and details such as a course waitlist and a course drop using an array of singly linked lists and a hashmap.</p>
